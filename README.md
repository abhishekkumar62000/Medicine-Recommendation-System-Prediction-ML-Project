# 🏥 **Medicine Recommendation System Prediction ML Project** 💊

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
Welcome to the **Medicine Recommendation System**! This is a **Machine Learning** project built in **Python** that predicts whether a particular medicine should be recommended to a patient based on their conditions and other factors. With **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering (FE)**, followed by the construction of a robust machine learning model, this project aims to help in **enhancing medical recommendations** using predictive techniques. 💡

## 🔍 **Steps in the Project**  

### 1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🕵️‍♂️  
Exploring the data in-depth is crucial to understand its **patterns**, **distribution**, and **anomalies**. Here’s what I did:  
- 💥 **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and outliers.  
- 🔍 **Univariate Analysis**: Investigated individual features through histograms and box plots.  
- 🌐 **Multivariate Analysis**: Analyzed relationships using pair plots and correlation matrices.  
- 🌟 **Insights**: Gained valuable insights that helped in feature engineering.  

### 2️⃣ **Feature Engineering (FE)** 🛠️  
I took the raw data and transformed it into meaningful features, improving the predictive power of the model.  
- 🔄 **Data Preprocessing**: Normalized and scaled the data for consistency.  
- 🧑‍🔬 **Feature Creation**: Introduced new features based on business understanding and data characteristics.  
- 💾 **Encoding**: Coded categorical features to numeric values using one-hot encoding.  
- ⚙️ **Dimensionality Reduction**: Used techniques like **PCA** to reduce the complexity of features.

### 3️⃣ **Model Building** 🧠  
With all the clean and engineered data, I built several machine learning models to identify the best predictor for medicine recommendation:  
- 🤖 **Logistic Regression** – Initial baseline model.  
- 📊 **Decision Trees** – Analyzing decision-making processes.  
- ⚡ **Random Forest** – Ensemble method to boost performance.  
- 🏎️ **XGBoost** – Cutting-edge gradient boosting algorithm.  
- 🔍 **Model Comparison**: Evaluated different models for performance.

### 4️⃣ **Model Evaluation & Results** 📊  
After building the models, I evaluated them using several metrics to ensure their effectiveness in recommending the right medicine:  
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correct predictions to total predictions.  
- **Precision & Recall**: Balancing the rate of positive predictions and the true positives.  
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall for balanced evaluation.  
- 💯 **Best Model**: Selected the model with the highest **F1 score** for final use.
